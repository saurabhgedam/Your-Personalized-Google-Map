# Your-Personalized-Google-Map
This is a project where I have used the Google Maps API to develop a web app which will detect your geo-location and show directions from your current location to the famous Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. It also allows you to add 2 stopovers along the way and shows all possible modes of transport that you can take. The path shown for each mode of transport is the most optimized one. Dont want the destination to be the Golde Gate Bridge? Simply change the HTML DIV tag with the ID 'end' to the destination of your choice, the app will take care of the rest. Also, do not worry about typos or entering the exact name  while entering the stopover location, the app takes care of it. (Note: Google Maps API does not display transit routes when there are stopovers involved)
